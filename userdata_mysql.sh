===================================================================>>>>>

after this we have to do these steps
sudo service mysql stop
sudo /usr/bin/mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &
mysql -u root mysql
#change passwd for this
UPDATE user SET Password=PASSWORD('YOURNEWPASSWORD') WHERE user='root'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES; exit;
